# ThinkOS
ThinkOS has two versions, the arch version, and the Windows version. They are both modified for ThinkPad devices.
The Windows version has 2 subversions, Windows MAIN, and Windows SERVER, Server has even more debloats than Main but may be more unstable.
The Arch Linux based version is harder for noobs, but is even more debloated than the Windows Server version.
